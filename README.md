# Stuff I Made
A simple list of some things I've made. It's so fun to create things that I honestly lose track once I usher things out into the world unless I maintain them for some purpose. To that end, the iOS Apps are very easy to track - Apple tells me about them every week. 

## iOS Apps
I began learning swift in 2017. I've published 3 apps to the iOS App store under the name Majik Productions (because you have to use your real name or create a business). I have a few others in progress. The biggest thing I learned while making apps is that the coding is the easy part - it is deciding what to do that is hard. All three of my apps solve a problem that I found in the world. 

### Crushing It

#### Status
Crushing It is live in the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/crushing-it/id1301094512?ls=1&mt=8)

#### What it Does
Crushing It is a tracking app that eschews distraction. You pick a thing you want to do, a target, and how many you’ve already done (if any). As you do the thing, you can tap dots to mark more as complete (or just edit the goal, if you don’t like tapping). The app tracks your progress and shows you in percent and with the color of the goal.

#### What it Does
Social Majik application lets users create images with text for multiple social media sites without having to repeat entries or change dimensions of images. 

Social Majik is designed for the small business owner, solopreneur, or other busy people who want to share similar posts on several platforms and want images sized properly without having to do it themselves. It also will store the theme and logo for the business super cheap (pro is just 2.99) and you never have to worry about setting up your images right again (like PicMonkey or Canva).
