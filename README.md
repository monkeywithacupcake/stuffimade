# Stuff I Made
A simple list of some things I've made (besides blogs..those are everywhere). It's so fun to create things that I honestly lose track once I usher things out into the world unless I maintain them for some purpose. To that end, the iOS Apps are very easy to track - Apple tells me about them every week. I closed Gifts Done in 2021 and sent last gifts in summer 2022. 

## Data Science

### Washington State COVID tracker

#### Status
No longer updated. 

I was updating daily here in [my covid wa github repo](https://github.com/monkeywithacupcake/covid-19-wa). The repo powered a [codepen](https://codepen.io/jessachandler/pen/zYGEbRK) that showed how cases and deaths were tracking over time by county.

#### What it does
I made a tracker when I felt like the details were not being tracked before the state rolled out the Tableau. Before that, there was no way to see trends or get a broader picture.

### Kitsap County Bike Map

#### Status
Actively building and growing.

#### What it does
Shows a map with pictures and details of places to park a bike in Kitsap County. There is an RPub and a Google Map Layer, so folks can use it on the go to find nearest bike parking.

#### Stack
Human (humans have to do a heavy lift here of identifying bike parking and taking pictures + adding to a google map is manual)
R

## Web App
I wanted to put my programming skills to use and make a real thing.  

### Gifts Done ![JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-js-green.svg)

#### Status 
Closed no longer maintained
~Gifts Done is live and working - we have fantastic reviews and I love making people happy with this application. [Gifts Done](https://www.gifts-done.com/)~

#### What it does
Gifts Done is a two sided platform that has users and suppliers who log in to individual dashboards. Users see their giftees and the progress of their gifts (automated gifting) and suppliers see the gifts that they have accepted responsibility for making. When Suppliers finish gifts, the images, prices, and details for items are emailed and updated for the user. Payments are handled through Stripe.

## iOS Apps ![Swift](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-swift-yellow.svg)
I began learning swift in 2017. I've published 3 apps to the iOS App store under the name Majik Productions (because you have to use your real name or create a business). I have a few others in progress. The biggest thing I learned while making apps is that the coding is the easy part - it is deciding what to do that is hard. All three of my apps solve a problem that I found in the world. 

### Crushing It ![Version](https://img.shields.io/itunes/v/1301094512.svg) 
#### Status
Crushing It is live in the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/crushing-it/id1301094512?ls=1&mt=8)

#### What it Does
Crushing It is a tracking app that eschews distraction. You pick a thing you want to do, a target, and how many you’ve already done (if any). As you do the thing, you can tap dots to mark more as complete (or just edit the goal, if you don’t like tapping). The app tracks your progress and shows you in percent and with the color of the goal.

It also will store the theme and logo for the business super cheap (pro is just 2.99) and you never have to worry about setting up your images right again (like PicMonkey or Canva).

## Gists
Gists are a great way to stash code and probably never look at it again. 
### [Encourage Me](https://gist.github.com/monkeywithacupcake/619664e95468fb59360555e0f79a9ed7) - Random string in shell 
### [Catch Phrase Maker](https://gist.github.com/monkeywithacupcake/9e0092733302668b2a4adbbfb1d35748) - Makes an image with a catchphrase, requires ImageMagick
